## Week 8: Feb 27, 2024. (Written February 27'th, 2024.) 

Today, I learned a wide variety of content, mainly abstract, and tools used for system architecture designs, such as user stories and how they eventually correlate to user journeys, functional user requirements, and their ties to User stories, among many others such as new languages and new language responses, so let's discuss them in more detail.

<a id="week-8-read"></a>

### READ THE RESEARCH & REFLECTION ASSIGNMENT

Upon reading the Research and Reflection journal's rubric and assessing my understanding with my teacher, I can confidently say what the Research and Reflection journal but first, before we begin, let me reflect on the questions I had initially set in place. 
When looking at the rubric, I had questions: what would this document be about? And if It's a journal, why are there references to the bibliography? 

My teacher clarified by saying, *"For bibliography and citations, Many weekly activities ask you to find specific examples online."*  [1:] Ashley, Blaquaire Professor, NIC, DLG-104: Slack. And for the documentation and general workflow: 
"In short: You should do the work first, all the while recording it in your Research and Reflection journal, then write a summary for Slack (if requested)"*  [1:] Ashley, Blaquaire Professor, NIC, DLG-104: Slack

This immediately clarified what this assignment is ultimately supposed to represent; it is not just a journal to reflect the information I learned, nor is it purely a research paper or essay; it's a combination of both, ultimately living in harmony and peace. 
To reflect on my earlier work, I had not planned it in advance, so with a skewed view of expectations, I included too many details about numerous different topics. However, this resulted in a chaotic mess of an issue, which resulted in me spending too much time fine-tuning and tweaking it until it correlated. Still, when even that was not enough, I tried it again until I ran out of energy and gave up. 

This is not going to happen with this project. Now that I know what is expected of me and have the resources to research and topics to fulfill, paired with a new-found appreciation and work schedule of college, in place of a mental breakdown caused by stress, I resolved that I could meet my teacher's expectations.

### Learn A NEW LANGUAGE

In this week's class, we were assigned into teams to work on a study relating to one of the following programming languages: Lua, Haskell, and Processing. My team and I were tasked to research Processing and answer the following questions:
+ What is the language used for?
+ Who uses the language?
+ What are some useful resources? 
+ Why are these specific resources useful?

#### What is the language used for? 

To answer what the language is used for, we'll first need to describe what Processing is. Processing is an event-based programming language and IDE that uses Java as a framework. 
The language includes multiple methods and frameworks for drawing components to the screen. A following example of a variable would be:
```Processing
color alive = color(0, 200, 0); 
/// Further code declaration.
```
Which uses the built-in color class to display a value of (in RGB) 
of 200G in the screen, this variable should then be used in loops or logic for an interactive system for the user. 

Processing has many built-in libraries such as Video, SVG, Serial, Network, DXF Export, and PDF Export Hardware/IO. Sound. [4:](#week-8-footnotes-learn) 
With those built-in libraries and the open-source nature of Processing, the number of possibilities or uses for displaying information becomes endless.
They can be used for both art, such as with Marius Waltz's art pieces [5:](#week-8-footnotes-learn)
The ease of use of Processing's syntax can allow students and hobbyists to learn programming without worrying about syntaxial requirements. 
With many libraries made by the community, such as Andreas Schlegel: Control P5 [5:](#week-8-footnotes-learn), Which allows the user to build custom user interfaces for desktop inside of Processing, and many others, Processing is a good app for designers and artists; the possibilities are endless. 

#### Who uses the language?

Processing users can fit into two categories: Programming Students and Designers: 
There are many reasons for those who wish to learn to code with Processing. 
For one, Processing is a straightforward language whose general flow is split into two sections:
```Processing
 public void setup() {
      // setup codes go here
    }
    public void draw() {
      // draw codes goes here
    }
```

Setup is the first class to run and is primarily used to declare variables, use references defined in the class's properties, mean-while Draw will output *"what you write within the draw block will be executed 60 times per second from top to bottom, until your program terminates."* [6:](#week-8-footnotes-learn)

This is a much simpler system to manage than declaring many different kinds of classes, objects, methods, and properties, such as with general Java syntax. It allows users to manage their output.
Since Processing is what I would like to call a **"drawable"** language or, to define it more narrowly, a framework or modules that allow specific classes, properties, and methods that enable ease of drawing objects on the screen, another example of this would be the Python modules, PyGame. [3:](#week-8-footnotes-learn)
Processing is also used with Designers and Prototypers. 
Since Processing allows you to display results in real-time, users can create short, simple games [7:](#week-8-footnotes-learn), develop prototypes for app websites, or display data with a flexible, interactive framework to boot. 
Of course, Processing is used by more than just designers, hobbyists, and classrooms. Still, it is widely used across multiple publications and for crucial events. 
It is used to create illustrations for publications in the British weekly scientific journal Nature and the New York Times and to produce sculptures [8:](#week-8-footnotes-learn) for gallery expeditions. 
#### What are some valuable resources?

Processing differs from many programming languages with a heavy focus on community and community-based learning rather than an academic or pseudo-academic approach that most programming languages fall under. 
This is much clearer when you look at Processing's official site: processing.org  
Which gives documentation [9:](#week-8-footnotes-learn), examples of effects [10:](#week-8-footnotes-learn), community, and access to custom libraries and tools developed by the community. [11:](#week-8-footnotes-learn)
Processing's website is the primary place for everything relating to Processing, with some tutorials such as Guide to the Processing Language Article [12:](#week-8-footnotes-learn) and, of course, YouTube tutorials such as The Coding Train's series Learning Processing [13:](#week-8-footnotes-learn)
These tools are helpful, as they provide an easy, condensed way to learn processing tools at a glance and allow beginners to integrate with Processing's community. To beginners, this is the push they need to provide an easy, life-long love of coding.

### REFLECT ON SLACK NEW LANGUAGE RESPONSES:

#### Reflect on Slack Responses: Haskell

From reading everyone's research regarding Haskell, I've learned the following things;
(Response from Antia Todd):
*"I've learned that, among many other companies, Microsoft uses Haskell for its serialization system, also called Bond, and that fundamental research sponsored by Microsoft has led to discoveries in the past few decades."*
(Response from Suhail Thechikodan)
*"I've learned that not only is Haskal used in web development but also for API development, such as the API generator built off of Haskell called Hasura, which creates GraphQL API Sources."*
 
#### Additional Research: 

Furthermore, I researched and ultimately learned about the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, [1:](#week-8-footnote-reflect) a machine code compiler written on and for the programming language Haskell, Developed by Kevin Hammond, and how, despite being initially developed back in 1992, it still has official releases up until this day. 
Ultimately, I've learned much more about a language than I had initially thought based on the initial description in class, including its history, research, and use cases. 

<a id="week-8-write"></a>

### WRITE A USER STORY

**This week in class, another team member and I were tasked with writing a user story, technical details I'll elaborate on further; the user story in question had to be an app that both my partner and I were familiar with, so after some discussion, we picked the app Go Transit [1](#week-8-footnote-write)** 

Go Transit is an App developed by Mathieu Méa; it shows the schedules, bus stops near the user's location, and news about the transit system and community. It indicates approximately when it will arrive and your time. Our task was to deconstruct the app and split its interface and ideas into separate user stories; you then may ask, what is a user story? 
Well, Max Rehkopf on Atlassian describes it as: 
*"A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer."* [2:](#week-8-footnote-write)

#### User stories have two general formats commonly used:
A response is usually written **"*As a User I can.....*"**:

Then, a description of the implementation. There are two ways that someone can further conceptualize the work: They can either describe more product features or, my favorite example, end cases. 
User stories are not used as system requirements; they are conceptual tools to help. However, teams and developers know a rough approximation of details, which technical information can then be thoroughly discussed, and expectations and goals for a project can be set. 
An end goal of a user story is to be used later in a user journey:
*"A user journey map is a visual representation of what a user must do to achieve a goal and outlines the experience they have with your brand."* [3:](#week-8-footnote-write)
As a more detailed representation, all of these steps can lead toward an MVP (Minimum viable product) and, hopefully, product documentation for the project by the end of the discussion. 
#### After discussing a user journey and briefly examining how it correlates to software engineering, let's return to the example I discussed in class:

**I decided to hone in on the app's main feature, knowing the transit system, so I wrote the following User Journey:**
- *"As a User, I can check trains near me."*
 	- Which was given the following end Cases: 
   - "The app must use the user's location, the app must aproapproximatere an closest bus should be, the app must show the buses number."
**Another one I wrote includes:**
- *"As a User, I can check how soon a bus will leave in correlation to my time."*
  - Which included the following end cases: 
   - *“The app must show the schedule of the chosen bus and the time when the bus will leave, approximating the user's current clock, the bus number, and the selected bus  
     location.”*
**Finally, the last one Included was:**
- *"As a user, I should see news and notifications relating to transit."*
 - Which had the final end cases: 
  - *"The app must use third-party sources to display data, the app must use UI to showcase top articles, the app must use a search system, and the app must integrate into     other aspects of the app, i.e, the homepage."*

In all, understanding user stories and how it corlates to the development process have been exceptionally useful as an learning experince

### CHOOSE A LANGUAGE FOR COMMUNITY CODE

### Programming Language Choice: 
I've researched and dipped my toes into the basics of various programming languages, from Python and Java to C# and C++. However, if this concerns languages I'm most confident in and can think through the back of my head, Java, Javascript, and C# should be my language of choice.
However, despite knowing the options I understand better, I wish to learn Kotlin.

#### Why Kotlin?

According to JetBrains, *"Kotlin is an open-source statically typed programming language that targets the JVM, Android, JavaScript, Wasm, and Native. Developed by Jet Brains [1:](#week-8-footnote-choose)"* Kotlin Docs FAQ [2:](#week-8-footnote-choose)
However, I initially had minimal experience with Kotlin, only researching it with some tutorials over winter break after last semester. During this term, DGL-104 Into mobile applications provided more resources for learning, Such as LinkedInLearning tutorials and exercises:  
While I have not used Kotlin for any hands-on project, I wish to learn Kotlin because of its integration with many JetBrains IDEs, more importantly, Android Studio. Because of the integration with Android Studio and other applications run through Kotlin, Kotlin has a sizable community of Android developers and repositories found on GitHub.

The main difference between communities such as Java and Kotlin is that Java and its following repositories mainly focus on APIs Exercise Tutorials Such as undiscovered-genius's exercise tutorials. [3:](#week-8-footnote-choose)
Or extensions or IDEs such as Node.js for modding or server hosting such as Paper Minecraft's Minecraft Server [4:](#week-8-footnote-choose) Most of the Java community primarily focuses on using Java as a baseline, then using the fundamentals provided and expanding upon them. While this is only the case across some projects, it makes it a lot harder for someone using the language with a basic understanding to choose a project easily without further researching the fundamentals of the IDE.
Meanwhile, Kotlin is a community focused on implementation, such as apps, code libraries, and frameworks, instead of branching out into many sub-categories with a flexible language like Java.
Also, as an aspiring App developer, I see numerous advantages to learning it as my language of choice.  
For example, Kotlin has much more condensed code because 
*"In Java, we must create references for views using findViewById. In Kotlin, that is taken care of automatically"* [11:](#week-8-footnote-choose) This reduces boilerplate code, such as getter and setter methods. And helps with general readability. 
And being null safe since Kotlin *"does not allow variables to be assigned with a null value."* [12:](#week-8-footnote-choose) and by adding Nullable types. 
Java also has ease of immutability through variables such as val and var [9:](#week-8-footnote-choose) rather than including type Const [10:](#week-8-footnote-choose) in the variable's declaration. 

####  Repositories I'm interested in:

- Unciv: (*"Open Source Android/Desktop Recreation of Civ V"*) [5:](#week-8-footnote-choose)
- LibreTube: ( *"An Alternative Front End to Youtube"* ) (I.E: The Youtube Viewer, but without all of the problems that come through YouTube's private policy, such as Taking hefty data from the users.) [6:](#week-8-footnote-choose)
- FreeForm: (*"Mi-Freeform 3 is an Android third-party freeform software that supports Android 8.1-Android 14"*) [7:](#week-8-footnote-choose)
// Personal Note: I don't know the full implementation, but has an smaller scope compared to the others Kotlin-Pokedex: (*"A Pokedex app using ViewModel, ViewBinding, LiveData, Room and Navigation"*)[8:](#week-8-footnote-choose)

<a id="week-8-star"></a>

### STAR GITHUB TOPICS AND REPOSITORIES OF INTEREST

**To simplify,** The previous article defined my chosen programming language and repositories of interest. 

#### To Reflect and explain: 

While going through the topics on Github, I approached them based on the view of programming languages, frameworks, or development that I'm interested in or something I will use shortly, such as Ruby, Lua, Or other languages. However, in the end, my topics ended up being too broad, so I condensed what my language choice would be; I chose languages that I am completely familiar with the basics and the languages I wish to learn, such as GML2 Code (GameMakerStudio2 Code.)
As someone whose long-term goals rely on the game industry, I want to find topics based on existing open-source or games with an open repository system project repository wishing to learn more about GML2; I searched it first. However, there were few Github Repositories relating to the Game Maker language: 
+ murilinhoPs: *"Mechanics Test GML"* [1:](#week-8-footnote-star)
+ mysterypaint: *"ProjectFlowerQueen"* [2:](#week-8-footnote-star)
However, these were not active nor a community focus, so I decided to Drop GML2 
so I looked at C# and tried to look for repositories that could accept someone of my level: I eventually found:
Jellyfin: *"A free media software system."* [3:](#week-8-footnote-star)
However, it seemed late into production, and with only a background in coding C# in Unity, Jelly-Fin seemed daunting, so I moved on. 
This eventually whittled it down to three languages: Java, Kotlin, and JavaScript. I initially went with Java since it is the language, besides C#, that I'm the most familiar with; however, looking at the scope of the repositories, It used too many frameworks for me to initially be confident to learn and overall use, in the month that we are provided. 
Javascript repositories ended up being something I was much more interested in, and the following repositories: 
homepage:  *"A highly customizable homepage"* (or start page & application dashboard)[4:](#week-8-footnote-star)
Blockbench: [5:](#week-8-footnote-star)  *“Blockbench - A low poly 3D model editor”* 
elementor: [6:](#week-8-footnote-star) *“The most advanced front-end drag & drop page builder.”* 
Each could give me valuable skills in Javascript. However, because I'm currently learning Java script concurrently with this assignment, further research would result in my classes becoming void or needing more attention for the projects. 
The explanation from Java earlier ultimately resulted in Kotlin and the Respriotries I chose as the language and repositories of interest. 

### FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AND REFLECTIONS

#### + *What is one exciting thing you've learned from researching programming languages and reading other students' posts about programming languages in response to the first activity?* 

The most exciting thing, as an aspiring game developer, is how much the multi-use of Scripting languages, such as Lua, can be used on numerous aspects of production, such as in the engine, or as an add-on to run scripts through already existing code inside a database. 
Another aspect that excites me is the ability to quickly identify and correlate Languages, their specific uses in development, who uses them, and the history behind them. Essentially, I give myself context for the language before I approach it. It is a beneficial resource for me as someone overwhelmed by what each language does and for whom brief descriptions don't personally suffice. 
#### + *What other programming languages might you consider to work with for DGL 104? What are your second choices, and why?*

My second courses are languages that can help me in potential internship opportunities as soon as possible, languages used for hobby work, or long-term goals such as programming through languages such as C# or C++ for Unity or Unreal engine.
However, there's also the aspect of attempting to reinforce my learning of a programming language I've learned or am currently learning, such as Javascript, Java, and, ultimately, Kotlin. 
#### + *What did you find most interesting when examining repositories on GitHub? Is there anything that surprised you or that you didn't expect? What similarities are there across some of the repositories you've starred?* 

What I found interesting about the repositories on GitHub is the vastness of projects, from personal to collective to official. The scope of differences between all the repositories will always be fascinating, and it gives me a glimpse of the development pipeline I will hopefully be a part of after college.
I've noticed that across all projects I've starred on Github, a recurring theme of short, descriptive projects with one specific goal, i.e., Applications rather than documentation. Those applications are either used for helping with a particular front-end problem or how most fall under the entertainment industry, such as front-end frameworks, apps, or video games, with only a few exceptions that help with media creation. 

<a id="week-8-conclusion"></a>
 
#### Conclusion: 

In all, This week was one full of discovery and testing out new waters; while there may not be a bit too many GitHub repositories and not enough outside resources for each section of this week's reflection, 
it's a starting point before fully submerging myself in my chosen resources.

## Week 9: 3/4/2024

<a id="week-9-read"></a>

### READ "HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN SOURCE"

I had always wished to get into development and contribute to open-source projects, even when I first began. Still, I needed to figure out where to start, and when I tried to dip into development, I got overwhelmed. I needed to figure out how else to help, so I didn't decide to prioritize it. 
However, after reading the How to Contribute to Open Source article, among many others, I understand how to look for open-source projects to work on and identify aspects I wish to develop and learn from.
While I initially only thought that you could contribute to open source through code, I discovered through the articles, my class, and the repository that *"A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. In fact, the other parts of a project are often neglected or overlooked."*  [1:](#week-9-footnotes-how) 
I can contribute to a project in a wide variety of ways. It can start as simple as finding issues in the code or testing the project on an Application scale, Or as complex as being a project maintainer, adding features, fixing bugs, or other ways that I can help with the project.

Here are the following ways that I could help with an open-source project:  *"Your contributions do not have to be exclusive to code. You can help a project by making comments on existing code and APIs to add context and writing documentation for the project."* [2:](#week-9-footnotes-how) Other project documentation can include install instructions, documentation hosted on another website, or Github pages for common problems or questions within the repository. 
There are also bug reports, quality insurance, and many other sub-categories to help with a project; the main ones that I want to focus on are debugging and debugging an easy or current issue. 
Regarding ways that I can help with projects and/or repositories, if it needs to be more apparent from the current scope of my Research and Reflection journal, I love to write and describe complex problems in simple detail. Therefore, documentation is a crucial aspect that I could focus on, more specifically, more complex or detailed documentation such as install instructions, FAQs, issue tagging, discussion, and categorizing. 

However, as stated earlier in my chosen language, I wish to get more comfortable with my language of choice. Debugging current repository issues is an essential and easy way to help fix my skills while also heavily contributing to the community. In a way, I can expand upon that implementation by helping debug and find issues for the second part of my community project with Javascript code. 

Regarding projects discovered through GitHub Explore, Open Friday, and other related categories, while determining whether my chosen project was fulfilled in finding potential projects to contribute to the section of my Journal, I inevitably found myself with three repositories that fit that criteria. AmpHTML, LibreTube, and CloudStream, all of which are heavily tagged and in active development, most of which have a description of the following tags: 
- first-timers only
- first contribution
  
In all it's an wonderful place to quickly dip my toes into project development and debugging, among many other jobs or tasks.

#### Conclusion: 

Reading the article taught me that there are multiple ways to contribute to Open-Source communities and that there's no natural **"wrong"**  way to contribute to the project. Despite seeming complex and terrifying, Open-source communities are an easy way to start development. 
To conclude my simple reflection, I wish to help repositories in any way I can, whether by debugging current issues or describing extensive documentation for the project. That aligns with my current goals and skills. More specifically, I wish to prioritize this as it is a good stepping stone to my future career as a developer. 

<a id="week-9-explore"></a>

### EXPLORE COMMUNITY CONNECTION

Upon looking into the research, Cloud Streaming and AmpHtml have apparent discord or slack servers that signal openness, discussion, and community amongst the project members; AmpHTML has a much more casual yet friendly tone among the projects, while CloudStreaming has a much more sarcastic and Dry tone among each repository. 
However, there is still an air of sudo professionalism in each community, with both categories for discussion relating to development, bugs, bug fixes, and other categories to foster and develop a sense of community. 

<a id="week-9-find">

### FIND POTENTIAL PROJECTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO

In class today, I learned the importance of open-source and the many diffrent aspects in which you can contribute towards development inside Github repositories. After reviewing the checklist in the What Means to Contribute article [1:](#week-9-footnotes-projects), I have decided that the Unciv Project may not be suitable for me, mainly due to needing issues component, making it much harder to find a code base. https://github.com/KaiKitKobold/Unciv-KatKitKoboldFork
I also looked at other projects, but the issues were either from last year or outdated and needed more development traction. 
After looking through most of the repositories, The following seemed to fit my criteria: 
+ Amphtml *"The AMP web component framework."*  [2:](#week-9-footnotes-projects) 
 However, It’s unlikely to be prioritized because the language component is much harder to finalize and identify. 
+ LibreTube *"An alternative front-end for YouTube, for Android."*  [3:](#week-9-footnotes-projects)
 This is likely the work that I end up prioritizing over the others. 
+ CloudStream *"Android app for streaming and downloading media."*  [4:](#week-9-footnotes-projects) 


While I did look at other repositories, either those relating to game development or game engine creation, they all checked off the boxes in the How to contribute to open source article [1:](#week-9-footnotes-projects)
The Article being what we'll base our criteria of an good repository to commit too. 

+ []Meets the definition of open-source
+ []Does it have a license? Usually, there is a file called LICENSE in the repository's root.
**The project actively accepts contributions.**
 + [] When was the latest commit?
 + [] How many contributors does the project have?
 + [] How often do people commit? (You can find this on GitHub by clicking "Commits" in the top bar.)
 + [] Next, look at the project's issues.
 + [] How many open issues are there?
 + [] Do maintainers respond quickly to issues when they are opened?
 + [] Is there active discussion on the issues?
 + [] Are the issues recent?
 + [] Are issues getting closed? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Issues page to see closed issues.)
**Now, do the same for the project's pull requests:**
 + [] How many open pull requests are there?
 + [] Do maintainers respond quickly to pull requests when they are opened?
 + []Is there an active discussion on the pull requests?
 + [] Are the pull requests recent?
 + [] How recently were any pull requests merged? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Pull Requests page to see closed PRs.)
**A friendly and welcoming project signals they will be receptive to new contributors:**
 + [] Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
 + [] Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (IRC or Slack)?
 + [] Do pull requests get reviewed?
 + [] Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?

To truly showcase a project that should be actively considered, let's focus on an example that only fits some of the boxes provided when referring to the broader scope. 

For this example, let's look at the GitHub repository: 

**[5: Kotlin Pokedex](#week-9-footnotes-projects)**

**This is an App for mobile devices that uses many diffrent features of Android Studio to make an immersive experience to view the entries and statistics for the video game series Pokemon.**

**Now, let's review the criteria and try to awnser the qustions that it provides:**

+ [+]Does it have a license?
  Yes, the repository has a license. 
+ [+] Does the project actively accept contributions?
  No, there have been no contributions to the repository in the past month. The last batches of comments were made in April 2023, and no attention was paid to the  
  repository afterward.  

**Now, let's see if it acurratley contains other cretirea:**

+ [+] When was the latest commit?
  November 2023, if you do not include the DenaBot Security Part 1
+ [+] How many contributors does the project have?
  10 If you do not count the DenaBot Security Bot. 
+ [+] How often do people commit? (You can find this on GitHub by clicking "Commits" in the top bar.)
  The last commits were in March 2023 and are only from the product's initial owner, mrcsxsiq, and updates of the DenaBot around that time. 
+ [+] How many open issues are there?
  There are around 8 open issues
+ [-] Do maintainers respond quickly to issues when they are opened?
  No, the last discussion was on October 15, 2023, and other issues around that time were not discussed. 
+ [-] Is there active discussion on the issues?
+ [-] Are the issues recent?
+ [-] Are issues getting closed? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Issues page to see closed issues.)
  The project had around 12 closed issues, the last of which was on October 31, 2021. 
**Now do the same for the project's pull requests.**:
The last closed pull request was on November 27, 2023. However, there is an active pull request, the most recent of which was on January 24 this year. 
+ [-] How many open pull requests are there?
  There are 24 Open pull requests, way more than the current issues. 
+ [-] Do maintainers respond quickly to pull requests when opened?
  The last pull request discussion was on an October 7, 2022, pull request.  
+ [?] Have the pull requests been recent?
  Technically, some are in this year, but most are from last year. 
+ [-] How recently were any pull requests merged? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Pull Requests page to see closed PRs.)
**A friendly and welcoming project signals that it will be receptive to new contributors:**
+ [-] Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
+ [-] Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (IRC or Slack)?
+ [-] Do pull requests get reviewed?
+ [+] Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?
  Yes, they do; as a tight-night small passion project, there is a vital source of friendly affirmation around, most of which could be displayed here [6:](#week-9-footnotes-projects)
  However, as we described earlier, the repository could be more active and is maintained mainly by the creator of the repository and the app. Also, the discussion    
  provided is from three years ago, so this project's heydays are over. 

As seen from above, while Kotlin pokedex [5:](#week-9-footnotes-projects) fulfills some categories, other categories still need to be improved, such as the repository attention and the overall community aspect needing to be better. 

#### Let's examine the other projects to see if they fulfill these requirements. To start, let's examine:
**Amphtml [2:](#week-9-footnotes-projects)**

It does have a license and a relatively descriptive and working read.me file and license for the project. 

 + [+] When was the latest commit?
   The last commit by a human developer was on February 29, 2024, by danielrozenberg 
 + [+] How many contributors does the project have?
   1'138 contributors
 + [+] How often do people commit? (You can find this on GitHub by clicking "Commits" in the top bar.)
   Most developers commit bi-daily if active; their corresponding support bot commits very frequently. 
   Next, look at the project's issues.
 + [?] How many open issues are there?
   896
 + [+] Do maintainers respond quickly to issues when they are opened?
   Maintainers usually respond within a week if the issue is a high priority or essential for the project's health and implications.
 + [+] Is there active discussion on the issues?
   Yes, there is active discussion among the main Maintainers of the project and active debate among technical aspects, including code snippets if the developers fix the      issue, an example of which would be the issue initially committed on February 30, 2024, which can be found here [7:](#week-9-footnotes-projects)
 + [+] Are the issues recent?
  Yes, there have been many issues even in the past week, all of which are descriptive, fully tagged to describe, and have descriptive titles and descriptions. 
 + [+] Are issues getting closed? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Issues page to see closed issues.)
  Yes, most issues are closed frequently every week, including one on March 4, 2024. There are a total of 13,375 issues closed in this project.
  **Now, do the same for the project's pull requests:**
 + [+] How many open pull requests are there?
  There are around 89 pull requests for the project. 
 + [+] Do maintainers respond quickly to pull requests when opened?
  Yes, the primary maintainers, such as erwinmombay and powerivq, discuss pull requests among each other and the committer relating to the project's overall goals. An   
  example of which is an open request done on March 4, 2024, is the following commit by zombifier [8:](#week-9-footnotes-projects) 
 + [+] Is there an active discussion on the pull requests?
  Almost every pull request, barring a couple of recent ones from the past couple of weeks, has a discussion with the maintainers. 
 + [+] Are the pull requests recent?
  There have been many pull requests in the past week and throughout the month as I write this, i.e, February 2024. 
 + [+] How recently were any pull requests merged? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Pull Requests page to see closed PRs.)
  There are around three pull requests from March 5, 2024, and many others from the past couple of weeks, all of which have been approved by the project's Moderators and  
  Maintainers. 
**A friendly and welcoming project signals that it will be receptive to new contributors:**
Quote from the first section of the Read.me file: *"AMP is a web component framework for easily creating user-first websites, stories, ads, emails, and more. AMP is an open source project, and we'd love your help making it better"* [2:](#week-9-footnotes-projects) 
 + [+] Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
   Maintainers respond helpfully to public questions about the issues and technical details around the project. 
 + [+] Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (IRC or Slack)?
   It is easy to find the social communities, support, and community in one of their own customs Read.me files. While friendly, the issues tab does have an apparent air of    casual professionalism between the developers and their Slack community, which is very informative and descriptive of the project's overall goals. 
 + [+] Do pull requests get reviewed?
 + [+] Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?


Overall, amphtml is an excellent source that ticks all the boxes as a repository to jump into and help; however, some things need to be revised from my personal goals that I need to pay attention to: 

+ One: 
  ampHTML is a Javascript-focused project. As a developer whose chosen language of focus for this semester is Kotlin and Android Studio, a mainly Web-based project, it    
  only partially aligns with my goals. 
+ Two: 
  There is already tons of documentation and active support; I get anxious about where to start regarding the repository and its focus as a leading project to focus on. 
+ Three:
  It does not personally excite me. While creating frameworks does sound fun, it is relatively abstract and high-level for my current skill set. That and its   
  overall purpose are something other than what I would mainly use or wish to focus on in my future career as a developer. 

Thankfully, we have two more repositories to look through and inevitably choose from, so let's divert our attention, with our checklist in hand, to Libre-tube [2:](#week-9-footnotes-projects), a repository that uses Kotlin, personally interests me, and aligns with my goals as a developer.

Now, let's see if LibreTube repository checks off all the checkboxes:

**Meets the definition of open-source:**
 + [+] Does it have a license? Usually, there is a file called LICENSE in the repository's root.
   Yes, the repository has a clear and descriptive license inside the repository detailing their copyright. 

**The project actively accepts contributions.**
 + [+] When was the latest commit?
   The latest commit was around an hour ago (As of March 5, 2024. at 12:02 PM PST)
 + [+] How many contributors does the project have?
   Around 283 contributors to the project. 
 + [+] How often do people commit? (You can find this on GitHub by clicking "Commits" in the top bar.)
   Daily, sometimes multiple times throughout the day, and across the week.
**Next, look at the project's issues:**
 + [+] How many open issues are there?
   There are around 35 open issues in the repository.
 + [+] Do maintainers respond quickly to issues when they are opened?
   The maintainers comment on and discuss certain sections of the project issues, even among closed issues.
 + [+] Is there active discussion on the issues?
   There is active discussion among the issues for both bug-fixing and transparent discussion between the maintainers and the issuer, the responses of which are iterative  
   and cordial. 
 + [+] Are the issues recent?
   Most issues are recent, with a large chunk being a subset of a previous issue, mainly this year, with a couple of older ones with tags to specify if it can't be   
   reproduced, low priority, bugs, etc. 
 + [+] Are issues getting closed? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Issues page to see closed issues.)
   Issues close reasonably frequently, with around three issued being closed on the day this is written (March 5, 2024.) 
   Most of them have discussions regarding the project. 
**Now, do the same for the project's pull requests:**
 + [+] How many open pull requests are there?
   There are only two open pull requests, one from two weeks ago and the other from January. Both of these have discussions and comments. 
 + [+] Do maintainers respond quickly to pull requests when opened?
   Yes, and they seem to have constructive and descriptive feedback relating to the pull requests, an example of which can be the feedback from the pull request around two 
   weeks ago (As of March 5, 2024, which you can see here [8:](#week-9-footnotes-projects)
 + [+] Is there an active discussion on the pull requests?
 + [+] Are the pull requests recent?
 + [+] How recently were any pull requests merged? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Pull Requests page to see closed PRs.)
   Project is welcoming
**A friendly and welcoming project signals that it will be receptive to new contributors:**
The project only has a definitive place for active discussion besides the code of conduct and commit stylization rules. 
 + [+] Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
   Maintainers and other developers respond very thoughtfully, friendlyly, and descriptively to issues, a reflection of which can be seen in both the tagging system and 
   the closed and open issues. 
 + [?] Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (IRC or Slack)?
   They are in the discussion forms; however, because there isn't a place to discuss the app, such as a Discord or Slack server, they don't fulfill the requirements in  
   place. 
 + [+] Do pull requests get reviewed?
   Pull requests are reviewed frequently, daily, and weekly; the number of open pull requests should be enough to determine the frequency fully. 
+ [+] Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?
  Yes, however, there seems to be a communication problem sometimes regarding the implementations of features of the maintainers/developers, including jokes in a 
  discussion pull request, the details of which are found here [9:](#week-9-footnotes-projects)

Overall, while there is some roughness to some of the project, LibreTube [2:](#week-9-footnotes-projects) also works entirely as a suitable repository to commit and follow through on primarily 
when referring to a hot topic in the modern application development space such as video/media players and has all the makings of an easy to jump into an open-source 
project. 

However, there are some things about the project that, while being a project I can focus on, personally make it so It's not something I wish to work on:

 + Primary Issue: 
 It's a repository that is already very late in its initial development, and because of that, there is already a lot of documentation that's already complete, such as a  
 detailed and professional read.me the file and overwhelming support for the project, It feels hard to really get my feet into a door when a potential issue could have 
 already been fixed by a much better implementation of the project, and in because of many ways to support the project already being done, and in such speed that it seems 
 complicated for me to implement the project.

While the previous repository was on the right track, let's see if:
**CloudStream [3:](#week-9-footnotes-projects)**
 Can fulfill my personal and the checklist requirements for a repository that is perfect for me.

Of course, like the others, the repository has an open-source license. 
 + [+] When was the latest commit?
   The latest commit was three days ago by self-similarity
 + [+] How many contributors does the project have?
   They have around 209 contributors to the project. 
 + [+] How often do people commit? (You can find this on GitHub by clicking "Commits" in the top bar.)
   While it's not daily, such as Libre-Tube, Multiple developers commit to the project weekly, on a week-by-week basis.
**Next, look at the project's issues:**
 + [+] How many open issues are there?
   There are 167 issues in total.
 + [+] Do maintainers respond quickly to issues when they are opened?
   Yes, as an example, An issue that was opened yesterday hours ago on March 5, 2024, As of (5:58PM) Already has a response by a maintainer [10:](#week-9-footnotes-projects)
 + [+] Is there active discussion on the issues?
   Yes, the most recent of which is dated 2 weeks ago, with an active discussion by a maintainer and the issuer. [11:](#week-9-footnotes-projects) 
 + [+] Are the issues recent?
   Yes, the issues are updated fairly regularly, most of which are committed on the weekend rather than daily, such as with LibreTube. 
 + [+] Are issues getting closed? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Issues page to see closed issues.)
   The issues close at the same pace as being updated towards the repository, frequently and with a discussion surrounding the repository. 
**Now, do the same for the project's pull requests:**
 + [+] How many open pull requests are there?
   There are around 16 open pull requests.
 + [+] Do maintainers respond quickly to pull requests when opened?
   Yes, the most recent of which is from the past week ago as of (March 5, 2024) [12](#week-9-footnotes-projects)
 + [+] Is there an active discussion on the pull requests?
 + [+] Are the pull requests recent?
   Most pull requests are as recent from this week or last week as of (March 5, 2024) 
 + [+] How recently were any pull requests merged? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Pull Requests page to see closed PRs.)
   They have merged fairly recently bi-weekly-by-weekly, with few being closed, and most have a review or comment when committing.
 + [+] A friendly and welcoming project signals they will be receptive to new contributors.
   The project has an open Discord server that, while heavy on sarcasm, is still a friendly and welcoming place to discuss it casually.
 + [+] Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
 + [+]Maintainers ask pretty descriptive questions when referring to bugs or technical problems. 
 + [+] Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (IRC or Slack)?
 + [+] Do pull requests get reviewed?
 + [+] Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?

Overall, Cloudstream [3](#week-9-footnotes-projects) ticks off many of the boxes, just like LibreTube

However, despite being rough around the edges and a much smaller project, Cloudstream works perfectly for a repository I wish to work on soon. 
Why? Well, there are numerous diffrent reasons: 

+ One:
  It uses my chosen language and focuses on in-app development, that is, media players and streaming services, which are in high demand and currently in the market. 
+ Two:
  It's a much smaller project with active participation. This is why I wish to prioritize Cloudstream rather than a repository such as Libretube, whose speed on commits,   
  issues, and pull requests is overwhelming. This means that even if my code that fixes an issue takes a while, it won't be closed or already fixed by a maintainer as 
  efficiently. 
+ Three:
+ There are multiple aspects of the repository that I can quickly identify as needing work, such as the Read.Me, documentation, and specific issues and pull 
  requests that I can easily attempt to fix with my current skill set. 

CloudStream is my chosen repository because it is suitable for joining and easy to use to help develop the project.

### IDENTIFY ISSUES TO SUPPORT

**First Issue: AmpHTML [2:](#week-9-footnotes-find)**
Repository [1:](#week-9-footnotes-find)
The issue was first Opened on March March 4, 2021, by calebcordry 

The issue mainly relates to Screen Display and the Lack of Responsive Stylization that makes certain elements, such as a <a> link or button, be much smaller on all screen sizes across multiple layers; the issue is mainly CSS-related. 
The issue has already been fixed through discussion to make the button and the contents dynamic for the screen size. However, it remains open with a text element called Added New Styles to Amp-Story-auto-ads to provide compatibility. UI across all resolutions 
It was reopened but Failed due to not passing checks and not having enough reviewer discussion amongst each other. [3:](#week-9-footnotes-find)

Where I should start when referring to that current issue is mainly looking at Either the CSS Or The JS. If the JS uses Dom from the CSS or if the CSS class by itself is decapitated, if possible, I should use relative units for the element, id class, or pseudo selectors used inside the CSS, making sure that if they depend on specific sizes, either use a media selector or a much more calculated size selector that uses percentages, or EM for short. 
If the issues are already fixed, I can provide more CSS classes to use as templates for small or larger screen sizes and ensure they are responsive across the Media Selectors provided in the project. 

A thorough code scan would be needed to identify and implement the corresponding issue. 

**Second Issue: LibreTube [5:](#week-9-footnotes-find)**
Repository: [4:](#week-9-footnotes-find)
The issue is a Display issue (The steps of which are reproducible); 
When clicking a comment with a time stamp in the video, The comment expands to fit the screen size. More specifically, tapping on the comment expands rather than just pointing the video duration to the specified time stamp. 

There are currently no comments on the issue. However, it does have proper tagging from a maintainer and is a relatively recent issue; it was initially Committed On March 3, 2024. 

While the technical details are not something I can certainly guess at this moment, I'd focus on either the pointer or function that causes the comment to expand and see if the time Stamp is the issue in how it references the source. If touching an inheritable comment expands the UI, I'd like to make a separate implementation, add a property to the text, or dereference the text from the UI's variable.

**Third Issue: CloudStream [7:](#week-9-footnotes-find)**
Repository: [6:](#week-9-footnotes-find)

This is more of a feature request than a bug-fix implementation. The issue is asking for a better aspect ratio and video resizing located in the internal video player; they argue that since the video sources come from a wide variety of formats, some sources do not display well with the current options the requester, therefore, wishes for the following implementations: 
Best Fit
Fit screen
Fullscreen
16:9
16:10 and other aspect ratios

To implement or fix the sources provided, I would work on how the current video sizes are implemented, what tools they use, or what classes or objects they are primarily based on, and then implement them with a responsive yet still flexible implementation for the 16:9 and 16:10. 

For Best Fit, Fit Screen, and Fill screen, Implementations use the current user's device; therefore, view-based device-based get methods would be required for the other video implementation functions. 


Overall, Of all the issues I looked through for each repository, I'd say that AmpHTML is an implementation that I can more accurately identify and fix since It's not explicitly code-based (Unless it's a DOM JS implementation, that is, the root of the issue), something such as the CloudStream View-based settings are things that while complex, I can quickly understand and inevitably implement. 

<a id="week-9-reflection"> 

### FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AND REFLECTIONS

#### What is the most surprising thing you've learned about open-source development and/or open-source communities during your week-long research?

The most surprising thing I may have reiterated across other aspects of the journal is how significant yet relatively simple Open-source communities and development are. As a culture, we tend to focus on the finished project rather than the steps required to make it. Given the large, complex, and ever-expanding code bases, this can make approaching an open-source project and contributing to it seem daunting. 

However, despite the complexity and multi-fascinated nature, other ways to help, such as documentation and issue tracking, which we described earlier in this lesson, seem more manageable. Despite projects seeming extremely Professional and high-brow, they are a team of passionate people with goals, dreams, and struggles, like everyone else. They are willing and even encouraging fresh blood for the project. 

#### What types of open-source projects do you find yourself most drawn to? Is there an apparent connection between them?

As someone wishing to get into Game Development Long Term but studying Web/App dev to have a stable income and backup plan and dip my toes into development to see if the process is proper for me, I obviously find myself drawn to projects that relate to Games, Game Engines, Modding frameworks relating to that industry, etc.
But I also see myself drawn into application/app Development, especially apps used to Stream, Download, or otherwise display Videos. Even if it's a Framework that uses the implementation of a separate app altogether, such as CloudStream and LibreTube, this may be a sign that I should learn more about the dependencies and common code patterns or functions used for those apps/applications. 

#### Is the programming language you chose last week still right? Should you consider alternatives?

The programming language I chose is still the right choice. Still, a problem that has quickly sprung to my mind is debugging and emulating. I do not have the funds or means to buy an Android device. Therefore, I must rely on emulation through Android Studio to debug and test. Otherwise, I will be able to test and develop those applications fully. 

The problem arises because my Laptop cannot Run an Emulator of an App on any Device or API in particular, which is a high-priority problem. Now I'm thinking and saving up to switch my Laptop to a much higher-end one that can fulfill its development needs; however, that may not happen sooner, and If I end up Adding or Editing code to any project Reposistory, I may not be able to check it thoroughly. 

Therefore, I may switch gears to a project such as ampHTML and use Javascript, a language I know can run and debug thoroughly on my current device.

## Week 10: 3/12/2024

<a id="week-10-assess"></a>

### ASSESS EXTERNAL COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

Upon researching each aspect of the External Community Contribution Guidelines, I finally concluded that contribution guidelines are much rarer upon most smaller open-sourced projects. However, there is also other ways to access them:


#### CloudStream:

My chosen community, CloudStream, does not have an official contribution document or, more specifically, a Contribution.MD document, they also didn't host any information in their read.me or other various files to showcase, So I joined their discord server Lagrapps. to ask them directly, paired with my issue identification, helped give them a better idea of what I was asking them. 

The following screenshots are of my discussion between the main mainters on the server and myself. [1:](#week-10-footnotes-asess)

TODO: ADD IMAGES.

Overall, They were very friendly, and answered my questions fully, gave confirmation provided resources in order to start the implmentation of my feature, and helped give an helping hand if I wished to ask further questions, Overall, they were very corudual and helpful with the program. 

(However, finding out what I should do next, is an Research & Reflection heading in of itself, but I’m getting off track.) 

#### LibreTube: 
LibreTube is an fairly awkward example, mainly due to the fact that they do not have an community aspect; that being an Discord, Slack, or other social aspect besides discussion relating to pull-requests and issues, As Well, LibreTrube does not have an Contributing document, the only document that they do provide is an Code-of-Conduct.md document [2:](#week-10-footnotes-asess) That while critical towards the community, only provides vague instances of what is deemed to get kicked from their community or offenses, which does not illustrate if they accept contributions and, if any or there syntaxial rules or development that needs to be prioritized. 

#### AmpHTML: 

Unlike the others, AmpHTML has a Contributing.Md document [3:](#week-10-footnotes-asess), so let’s examine it and scrutinize it more explicitly.

AmpHTML has extensive documentation based on contributing rules and steps, bug reports, and feature requests, including detailed documentation for each.

### CONTRIBUTE TO EXTERNAL COMMUNITY

While this weekly exercise was done a week ahead of schedule, The contributing steps I’ve taken for my external community is a Reflection and a Case Study in of Itself about how you don’t have to contribute code to make a difference and that most of this week’s content was also accurately reflected in week 11’s Assignment, Connect with your external community, So let’s delve into the specifics, shall we?

I had initially started with identifying an issue, in this case helping with more view settings for the video player, the light discussion of which is showcased on our previous example [1:](#week-10-assess)

They helped provide documentation for me to help develop my contribution in this case being developing extensions, However as I followed along with the tutorial, I ended up realizing that the scope of the learning required in order to develop the extensions, ended up being too large. 

For example, not only did I need to learn scraping, and how to develop extensions while also remembering what I’ve learned about Kotlin and Android development (That being somewhat complicated in itself.), but I also didn’t know where I was supposed to put my code, or what extensions or functions I needed to use. 



So I decided that the current implementation was way out of the scope of my project, So I decided to take a step back and asses the repository. 

I quickly remembered that, when attempting to look at this project, I was very bewildered on where to start, if the community was accepting pull requests/ issue tracking and documentation, I finally knew a way I chould help make that more clear, while also inducing an sense of professionalism within the project, that being updating the read.me: 

It was initially in this state, and overall, was pretty lacking in detail and felt like the bare minimum of what was required; while it did sell the idea of CloudStream, give a warning, and provide documentation to the socials, It did not communicate other aspects of the project, such as links to documentation, templates, rules or much really, in comparison to its contemporaries such as LibreTube, it feels pretty unprofessionalism in response. 

So with the community thumbs up, I started working on the project, and while I could go over each step of the project, my communication with the dev and maintainers, review, pull request and what I learned during this project, It’s better to fully showcase the end product of my commit to the repository. 

Overall the Read.Me still hasen’t been completely finished, It’s currently on review and I’m on stand-by until I hear back from the maintainers of the project, I’ve been rewriting this read.me for a bit, and this is currently the third/fourth revision. However, I’ve learned a lot not just about the project but also about development as a whole, just by talking with the community and reading more about the documentation and sources.

### CONTRIBUTE TO PATTERN-LIBRARY


Well, I had finished my initial contributions to the pattern library. However, I would say that It did not take an hour to finish, more so an entire day and a half to finish (With other work such as UI/UX Prototyping being included) to implement the contributions, so let’s look deeper at how I’ve contributed to our internal pattern library so far. 

Initially, my priority was the document structure for the Pattern library since everyone needed a place to put their content. Otherwise, it will end up being all over the place in the long run, and those who commit before we begin have to either move it or focus on it at a later date; either way, it helps fix many problems with the directory, Me, my Teacher, and Ting Chen (My class-mate) all got together to discuss it in more detail. At the same time, I initially attempted to commit the changes, It ended up not showing up on the directory. 

That was mainly due to me needing to know that Github required content to appear or even show-up as a folder. Therefore, Chen had her pull request finished; however, despite having some folder structure, the root problem of the folder structure wasen’t fixed. 

Once I learned that you needed content for the folders to appear, I added Read.Me’s to each repository, and organized them as discussed. This also required that I focus on the other aspectsl, to streamline the Read.me, such as adding a Table of contents with hyperlinks to each repository for ease of access. 

Afterwards, I did my Dart implementation. The further specifics of the process can be seen in the follow-up questions and reflections section below.

###  FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AND REFLECTIONS

#### What is the hardest/most challenging thing you had to do this week for DGL 104? How did you overcome this challenge?


If we refer to the week the week this was assigned, then the most challenging part was definitely bringing this document over from Grammarly, to GoogleDocs, for a more accurate hierarchy and easier use of the document as a whole, last week a lot of stuff came up, Intense Stress, physical health problems coming back, taxes, etc, therefore I was behind on most of my schoolwork, including this journal. 


However, if where referring to the week this was written 1.3, then there is actually more backstory that I can describe. From, Obviously Catching up on this week’s content across each class was the primary doozy that put me in, however…
I would say that researching and writing code for Dart was exceptioanlly tough, while scanning the documents did give reassurance that it had many similarities to Java, there were other aspects such as troubleshooting code (Since example code that I based my implementation off of had Syntax and other errors on run time that showed up on VsCode, I ended up in an cycle, which funnily enough is just the normal development cycle. 


That being, Implement Test, Attempt to Fix error by looking at documentation, Fix, Error, Look at Stack Overflow, Fix, Error, Look back at Docs, and then have something that works, Near the end the, code ended up  having bugs and errors that I didn’t know how to implement, So I asked chatGPT, and it helped provide some operators and functions that I didn’t know was possible in Dart, which made the lazy implementation an lot easier in comparison.

### READ THROUGH PATTERN LIBRARY ISSUES: 

Looking through the Pattern Library issues, I’m pleasantly surprised by the amount of new issues that showcase languages, different types of programming patterns, and wide variety of ideas on display, as the unofficial pattern library folder structure/ table of contents on the Read.ME, I think It’ll be interesting my update-time and work flow when referring to that aspect of development, regarding issues I’ve chosen to research or help I decided to review an Read.Me Essay implementation of Fuctional programing vs Object-orianted programing [2:](#week-11-footnotes-read), for my reviewed pull request, Overall the pull request had good formatting, easy-to-identify Headings, and Images and was a good showcase of the issue, I gave it my thumbs up. 

To propose a new file name scheme for all pattern file issues [1:](#week-11-footnotes-read) I decided to throw my own hat in the ring and help define a file name scheme, I saw across most of the pattern libraries, a simple file description that details the pattern such as Singelton.js, Since our project has implementations across different languages I eventually decided that a file name with underscore for readability such as singleton_JavaScript.js or Singleton_JavaScript.js would work best for the project.

###  FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AND REFLECTIONS

#### Determine if your chosen programming language is OOP capable. To what extent does it support OOP? Fully, or partially? Does it support any other paradigms? Wikipedia has a good list of multi-paradigmatic programming languages.


Dart [1:](#week-11-footnotes-follow) is indeed has full object-oriented support with support for classes, objects, constructors including factory constructors, Attributes/Field and much more specific frame-works which I won’t go into more detail in here  Since Dart is widely used as an academic and *“formal”* language, it provides support for other paradigms such as functional, imperative, and even reflective languages. 


Dart also has an wide variety of ways that it can compiled such as [2:](#week-11-footnotes-follow)
*“machine code, JavaScript, or WebAssembly. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics and type inference.”*
